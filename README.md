# Statistics
## Measure of Central Tendency
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode

## Measure Of Dispersion
1. Variance
2. Standard Deviation

## Histogram and Probability Density Fuction for Different Distribution
1. Normal or Gaussian Distribution
2. lognormal distribution
3. Power Low Distribution


## Finding Outliers from dataset
- Using IQR
  1. Sort the dataset
  2. Calculate Q1(25%) and Q3(75%)
  3. IQR = (Q3-Q1)
  4. Find the Lower Fence = Q1-1.5*(IQR)
  5. Find the Higher Fense = Q3 + 1.5*(IQR)
- Using z-score
- Using Boxplot by seeaborn library
